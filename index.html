            <p>  Being born and raised in the heart of it all, the great state of Ohio, many might expect that 
                    I am a die hard OSU fan and the assumption is correct. I like to think of myself as a secret 
                    supporter due to the burden of keeping up the guise. Frankly, I only care about football when I
                    am amongst my fellow buckeyes. I suspect that there are other out there. Some who feel that 
                    Brutus does not quite get how we feel. We are the forgotten ones. We bleed scarlet and gray
                    from dawn to the dying of the light. We are the ultimate spectators. No need for loudness. No need
                    for roodness. We simply exist, we live life, we watch football, we get excited on occasion.
                    We know that no matter what we are "Buckeyes". Wins and losses won't change my mood. It won't make
                    me depressed. No chaos required.
            </p>
            <p> Enter, Aspiring Web Developer Stage left. Yes, I know I have just refered to my self in
                    the third person, but that is how it is. But let us let the main thing be the main thing.
                    My method of solving problems is to visualize 
                    the solution as a bag of cats waiting to be released. Wierd analogy, right? We have to release
                    the cats and let all the chaos out sometime before the underlying issue can be solved. You could
                    say that I am comfortable with a certain level of it and have found that once all the questions have
                    had their day in the sun the solution is obvious. In short, my name is Kourtney, I like to find
                    solutions in the chaos, while contributing to it as little as possible. I am usually successful at both.
